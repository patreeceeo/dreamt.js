### Example

The code below is just meant to be illustrative, it is not _necessary_ a functioning program.

```javascript.jsx
/* GolfBallMesh.jsx */
import * as React from 'react';

// Using primatives from react-three-fiber
export const GolfBallMesh = ({position, rotation}) => (
  <mesh position={position} rotation={rotation}>
    <sphereBufferGeometry args={1}/>
    <meshBasicMaterial color="blue"/>
  </mesh>
)

/* main.js */
import * as Dreamt from 'dreamt';
import {withNetworking, withScript, withReactThree} from 'dreamt/components';
import {GolfBallScript, BilliardBallScript} from './scripts';
import {selectCurrentWorld, selectYourTurn, selectError} from './globalState';

Dreamt.defWorld("minigolf", ({yourTurn}) => {
  const entities = [
    Dreamt.defEntity(
      withNetworking(),
      withScript(GolfBallScript, {yourTurn}),
      withReactThree(GolfBallMesh)
    ),
  ];

  return {entities};
}, {
  "data.selectors": {
    yourTurn: selectYourTurn,
  }
})

Dreamt.defWorld("billiards", ({yourTurn}) => {
  const entities = [
    Dreamt.defEntity(
      withNetworking(),
      withScript(BilliardBallScript, {yourTurn}),
      withReactThree(BilliardBallMesh)
    ),
  ];

  return {entities};
}, {
  "data.selectors": {
    yourTurn: selectYourTurn,
  }
});

const engine = new Dreamt.Engine(
  ({currentWorld, error}) => {
    if(!error) {
      Dreamt.visitWorld(currentWorld);
    } else {
      displayErrorScreen(error);
    }
  },
  {
    "network.socket": {
      path: "/socket",
      params: {
        playerId: () => localStorage.getItem("playerId")
      },
      topic: "sportballs"
    },
    "data.selectors": {
      currentWorld: selectCurrentWorld,
      error: selectError
    }
  }
)

// Start this whole shebang!
engine.loop();
```

### Developing

These steps need to be performed whenever you make changes:

0. Write awesome code in the `src` directory.
1. Build (clean, lint, and transpile): `npm run build`
2. Create unit tests in the `test` directory.
3. Verify code coverage: `npm run cover:check`
4. Commit your changes using `git add` and `git cz`
5. Push to GitHub using `git push` and wait for the CI builds to complete.

Note: This project uses automated changelog generation as long as you follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org), which is made simple through the included [Commitizen CLI](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/).

### Releasing

Follow these steps to update the NPM package:

0. Perform all development workflow steps including pushing to GitHub in order to verify the CI builds. You don't want to publish a broken package!
1. Check to see if this qualifies as a major, minor, or patch release: `npm run changelog:unreleased`
2. Bump the NPM version following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) by using **one** of these approaches:
   - Specify major, minor, or patch and let NPM bump it: `npm version [major | minor | patch] -m "chore(release): Bump version to %s."`
   - Explicitly provide the version number such as 1.0.0: `npm version 1.0.0 -m "chore(release): Bump version to %s."`
3. The push to GitHub is automated, so wait for the CI builds to finish.
4. Publish the new version to NPMJS: `npm publish`

### Contributing

0. Create a fork on GitHub
1. Use the [Suggested Development Workflow](#development-workflow)
2. Create a GitHub pull request from your fork

Alternatively, (though less awesomely):

0. Create an issue on GitHub
1. Describe the issue in as much detail as possible. This makes up for not going the pull request route.
   - What happened
   - What did you expect
   - What browser/OS versions were you using
   - What have you tried to fix
